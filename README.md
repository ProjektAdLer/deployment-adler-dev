# Update
increase version in adler_version.yml to a later [release of the AdLerStack](https://github.com/ProjektAdLer/AdLerStack/releases).
Downgrades are not supported.

docker-compose.override.yml and .env files will be copied to the deploy branch, together with the docker-compose.yml from the AdLerStack release.
The deploy branch will then be deployed.
